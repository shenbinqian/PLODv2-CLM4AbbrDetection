# The SDU dataset

The SDU dataset is from the English scientific folder of the AAAI-22-SDU-shared-task-2-AD github (https://github.com/amirveyseh/AAAI-22-SDU-shared-task-2-AD) as described in our paper.

We combined their train and development sets (train.json and dev.json) as one file--test_bio.conll to test our models and compare with previous SOTA results. The train, and val datasets (train_bio.conll and val_bio.conll) are pseudo data for the convenience of calling functions. ONLY test data is used for prediction.
